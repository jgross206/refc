## Rich Eisen Fan Club Power Rankings Week 5

We're into the fifth week of the season. The Seahawks are bad and Russell Wilson has been spending more time than usual in hospitals. Things are getting spooky in Seattle so in honor of the season, the theme of this week's power rankings is...

ðŸŽƒ **HORROR MOVIE VILLAINS AND MONSTERS** ðŸŽƒ

### 1. Sandro the Necromancer - Jason Voorhees

![Jason](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719695/136672783-8fc4ba4c-2948-40cb-ade4-4f4e88ad523d.png)

This team is looking primed for a deep playoff run after week 4, and the lynchpin was a gutsy trade after week 1.

Sandro facts:
- After week 1 Sandro made a trade with Suey that netted him the WR1 and RB10 in exchange for the WR20 and the RB8 (who just got placed on IR)
- Sandro picked up the WR5 DJ Moore with pick 4.10, making him the 18th WR selected.

Jason facts:
- Jason is almost completely nonverbal. Other than a few painful grunts after he got stabbed, his only vocalization came in *Jason Takes Manhattan* where he cries out "Mommy, please don't let me drown!" in a child's voice before being submerged in toxic waste
- They've showed Jason's face a few times over the years:

1988:

### 2. Team ryanvytlacil - Chucky

Happy to see a rookie making noise already. That Mahomes/Tyreek stack can carry you to the promised land.

Vytlacil facts:
- "The stack" is responsible for over 50% of Ryan's total points this season
- Out of four games played so far, Tyreek has one game with 2.9 and one game with 4.7 points. Nevertheless, he's the WR2


Chucky facts:
- Charles Lee Ray was a human serial killer who transferred his soul into a doll as he lay dying in the street
- Chucky was a puppet in the first film which caused a problem for wide shots because there was no way to hide the puppeteers. They solved this problem by hiring 3'4" Ed Gale and building a set with all the props 30% larger than normal. They even set him on fire:

- Another time Chucky was played by the main kid actor's sister, which is kind of unsettling:

### 3. Team Hathaway - Michael Myers

![image](https://c.tenor.com/7razvLnYvC4AAAAC/scary-threat.gif)

Gotta respect 4-0, but there are some holes in this team.

Hathaway facts:
- Tyler Lockett is currently WR6 but his scores over the last 3 games? 3.1, 2.4, 5.7
- The second best performing RB on this team is Kenneth Gainwell (RB27)

Michael facts:
- John Carpenter initially conceived the character as being inhuman, a personification of pure evil. When Rob Zombie rebooted the franchise in 2007, he decided to give Michael more of a backstory, including multiple childhood flashbacks where he speaks. When Carpenter was consulting for the 2018 sequel he took some shots at Mr. Zombie: "I thought that he took away the mystique of the story by explaining too much about Michael Myers. I don't care about that."
- They've shown his face a few times and he just kind of looks like a dude:

### 4. CoolTime FunkyFlex - Freddie Krueger

![freddy](https://giffiles.alphacoders.com/259/25930.gif)

1-3 is a brutal record for how well this team has done so far. Looking good, but a lot is riding on Henry.

CTTF facts:
- In 9th place with a 1-3 record, cool time is only 7.02 away from leading the league in total points
- Despite his nickname, Ryan Tannehill (QB20) has not been very useful. Derrick Henry has scored more points.
- Speaking of Henry (RB1) he's outscored Ekeler (RB2) by over 20 points so far

Freddy facts:
- Freddy Krueger started out as the Springwood Slasher, a child murderer burned to death by a mob of victim's parents. In the original strip he was a child molester but Wes Craven changed it because of news events.
- Compared to the strong silent type Jason and Michael Myers, Freddy is a goofy chatterbox. Some famous one-liners include
    - "Wanna suck face?"
    - "Welcome to prime time, bitch!"
    - "I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy."

### 5. Hermione Granger â€” The Thing

![thing](https://media0.giphy.com/media/IhNzvlaWhuOE1ZwMoE/giphy.gif)

Overall solid team, nothing super exciting but the Rams guys + Kelce should carry Ham to a plaoff spot.

Hermione Facts:
- Darrel Henderson, the 26th RB selected, is currently RB6
- Matt Gay, K5 going into this week, is only rostered in 43% of Sleeper leagues

The Thing facts:
- There are no women in the entire movie
- The scene where Norris' chest opens up and eats the doctor's arms off was filmed using a double amputee stunt double with prosthetic arms.

### 6. Team USA - Patrick Bateman

![p](https://c.tenor.com/EFoo9AxzVU0AAAAC/patrick-bateman-american-psycho.gif)

It's all been a downward spiral since McAffee got hurt. My hopes are resting on his ability to come back, or perhaps a waiver-miracle season from Cordarelle? 

USA facts:
- Cordarelle Patterson (RB3, waiver pickup) has already produced more fantasy points through 4 games than he did in 16 games last year.

Patrick Bateman facts:
- In the book Bateman kills a businessman named Paul Owen. In the movie, the name was changed to Paul Allen for no apparent reason, which led people to believe the character was based on the late Seahawks owner.


### 7. Pacman Jones - Leatherface

![lt](https://media2.giphy.com/media/3o7aTuy3b4TwuUSUzm/giphy.gif)

Crazy QB depth on this squad.

Pacman facts:
- We already covered his trade with WTBT, so lets check on the pre-season swap with CTTF
    - Matt gave up Chris Carson (RB21) and received James Robinson (RB11)
    - Carson was having a solid season until his injury. He hasn't been put on IR so looks likely he could come back in the next couple weeks to help out Geno. Jury's still out on this one.

Leatherface facts:
- Leatherface is a quintessential family man. Everything he does he does for his family, in particular his older brother who beats and abuses him.
- Leatherface was inspired by real life serial killer Ed Gein (aka the Plainfield Ghoul), who wore the faces of his victims as masks.
- The director tried hard to get a PG rating, which is why there's very little blood in the movie.

### 8. Suey Lagoon - Ghostface

![scream](https://media3.giphy.com/media/l2YWoE1MjEPo9sG3K/giphy.gif)

OBJ has been painful, but Hurts has been an analgesic. Gonna be a dogfight but Aaron Jones could take Suey to the playoffs.

Suey facts:
- Jalen Hurts (QB5) was a nice pick at 9.9, the 12th QB selected


Ghostface facts:
- 9 different people have killed while wearing the costume throughout the franchise. Surprising names among the list include Timothy Olyphant and Tyga. Yes, that Tyga.
- Despite the fact that, in-universe, ghostface masks are widely available and many of the killers are "copycats", they all share certain mannerisms and an unexplained supernatural durability.

### 9. WillTime BigTime - Jigsaw

![js](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fe/ab/1f/feab1f3b49ade709bbc2f5ae8dcf8dac.gif)

I think this team is better than its record and even its points scored. Still going to be a real struggle.

WTBT facts:

- We all know what happened with the blockbuster pre-draft trade between WTBT and the Boobie Boys, so lets check in on the opening day trade with Pacman.
    - WTBT received Thielen (WR13) and Robert Tonyan (TE30, dropped to free agency) in exchange for Blake Bortles (QB70, dropped to free agency by both Pacman and the Green Bay Packers) and Amari Cooper (WR15)
    - So basically this trade was Thielen for Cooper which is a diffence of less than 3 points so far
- Dawson Knox (TE3) was a killer free agency pickup. Kudos

Jigsaw facts (not a lot of interesting facts so instead I'll list some of the craziest traps he's come up with):
- Reverse Bear Trap-- a modified bear trap inserted into a victim's mouth. When it activates, it will tear their head apart at the jaw ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719695/136674874-215c58b4-487e-4fb9-94a0-439af52d8df0.png)
- Shotgun Carousel-- 6 people rotate on a merry-go-round, facing a loaded shotgun one at a time. a seventh has to choose who to kill ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719695/136674917-537135cd-7ca2-49c9-82c4-f643c4dc7d0a.png)
- Needle Pit-- A key is hidden at the bottom of a giant pit of hypodermic needles ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719695/136674930-95bf74ce-3339-4462-b116-84236dd6d2be.png)

### 10. Kam Chancellor Palpetine - Hannibal Lecter

![hl](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AlertSmoggyBluebird-size_restricted.gif)

Deebo is really the only bright spot on this roster besides Gronk, who is out with a lung. Doesn't sound great.

Palpetine facts:
- Deebo Samuel (WR4) at pick 8.5 is looking very nice right about now.
- Gronkowski is still the TE2 with only 2.5 games played. If he can get over this injury that 10th round pick KCP spent on him will be a bargain.

Lecter facts:
- Lecter is based on Alfredo BallÃ­ TreviÃ±o, a doctor who the author interviewed a few years before he was accused of serial murder.
- In the books, Lecter has a rare medical condition that causes him to have six fingers on one hand. This was lampshaded in the movie when an x-ray reveals that he amputated the extra digit.

### 11. Team Measurables - Babadook

![b](https://c.tenor.com/bR1T3Dz4npYAAAAC/babadook-crawl.gif)

Ekeler and DK are great pieces, but the rest of this squad is uninspiring.

Measurables facts:
- Darnold (waiver pickup) is QB7 and has already score more than 2/3 the points he did all of last season

Babadook facts:
- The Babadook is not real in-universe. It is a manifestation of the imagination and trauma of the main character.
- William Friedkin, director of *The Exorcist*, said this about the film: "I've never seen a more terrifying film. It will scare the hell out of you as it did me."

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719695/136676987-bbc3b2cc-f0b6-442f-bddf-cea26aafb1b4.png)

### 12. BoobieBoys - Ghostface

![s](https://c.tenor.com/LXfETEPaQ9QAAAAC/whats-up-scary.gif)

Brutal weakness at both WR and RB. Herbert and Chase are doing good work but after that it gets grim.

BoobieBoys facts:
- BoobieBoys is the most active player in the league in terms of # of transactions
- Lets check in on BB's many trades this season:
    - Gave up Najee Harris (RB13) to Sandro for Jamaal Williams (RB23) and Ja'Marr Chase (WR8).  I think I'd say BB won this one.
    - Gave up Calvin Ridley (WR35, injured) to Sandro for Ty'Son Williams (RB36). Calling this one a wash.

Scary Movie facts:
- The script was a combination of two projects which apparently were being worked on independently and simultaneously: "Last Summer I Screamed Because Halloween Fell On Friday The 13th" written by the Wayans brothers and Phil Beauman; and "Scream If You Know What I Did Last Halloween" by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. A real Newton/Leibniz situation
- The original tagline for the first movie was "No Shame. No Mercy. No sequel."
