## Rich Eisen Fan Club Power Rankings Week 5

We're into the fifth week of the season. The Seahawks are bad and Russell Wilson has been spending more time than usual in hospitals. Things are getting spooky in Seattle so in honor of the season, the theme of this week's power rankings is...

ðŸŽƒ **HORROR MOVIE VILLAINS AND MONSTERS** ðŸŽƒ

### 1. Sandro the Necromancer - Jason Voorhees

Sandro facts:
- After week 1 Sandro made a trade with Suey that netted him the WR1 and RB10 in exchange for the WR20 and the RB8 (who just got placed on IR)
- Sandro picked up the WR5 DJ Moore with pick 4.10, making him the 18th WR selected.

Jason facts:
- Jason is almost completely nonverbal. Other than a few painful grunts after he got stabbed, his only vocalization came in *Jason Takes Manhattan* where he cries out "Mommy, please don't let me drown!" in a child's voice before being submerged in toxic waste
- They've showed Jason's face a few times over the years:

### 2. Team Hathaway - Michael Myers

Hathaway facts:
- Tyler Lockett is currently WR6 but his scores over the last 3 games? 3.1, 2.4, 5.7
- The second best performing RB on this team is Kenneth Gainwell (RB27)

Michael facts:
- John Carpenter initially conceived the character as being inhuman, a personification of pure evil. When Rob Zombie rebooted the franchise in 2007, he decided to give Michael more of a backstory, including multiple childhood flashbacks where he speaks. When Carpenter was consulting for the 2018 sequel he took some shots at Mr. Zombie: "I thought that he took away the mystique of the story by explaining too much about Michael Myers. I don't care about that."
- They've shown his face a few times and he just kind of looks like a dude:

Vytlacil facts:
 â€” "The stack" is responsible for over 50% of Ryan's total points this season 
 â€” Out of four games played so far, Tyreek has one game with 2.9 and one game with 4.7 points. Nevertheless, he's the WR2 

Chucky facts: â€” Charles Lee Ray was a human serial killer who transferred his soul into a doll as he lay dying in the street 
â€” Chucky was a puppet in the first film which caused a problem for wide shots because there was no way to hide the puppeteers. They solved this problem by hiring 3'4" Ed Gale and building a set with all the props 30% larger than normal. They even set him on fire:

â€” Another time Chucky was played by the main kid actor's sister, which is kind of unsettling:
